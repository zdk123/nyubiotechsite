I am a PhD student in the Carlton lab where I am using computational models to analyze the neglected malaria parasite <i>P. vivax</i>. At the NYU Biotech association I am in charge of communications and outreach which means my main task is getting the word out there about our events but also interfacing with various other organizations like GRO Biotech. I want to motivate graduate students, postdocs and others to learn about the biopharma and biotech industries and get in touch with the great companies in the New York area.
