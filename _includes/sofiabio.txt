I am a PhD student in Dr. Robert Schneiderâ€™s lab, working on breast cancer at NYU School of Medicine. My goal is to elucidate the molecular basis for ER+ tamoxifen resistance and contribute to the discovery of new therapeutic targets that will be used for clinical intervention to benefit patients. I also serve as President at the NYU Biotech Association. My vision is to bridge the gap and forge collaborations among academia, healthcare industry and physicians. I am very interested in providing our members with opportunities to learn about areas of drug development, business, venture capital firms and life sciences entrepreneurship.
